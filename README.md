ðŸ›’ Amazon Clone

This is my Amazon Clone frontend project, built using HTML and CSS (with a touch of JavaScript).
I started with inspiration from the Apna College Amazon Clone tutorial, but I went beyond the basics and added a few custom changes to make it closer to the real Amazon homepage.

âœ¨ Features

ðŸ”¹ Navbar with search bar, account, and cart icons

ðŸ”¹ Hero Section with an image slider (my custom addition)

ðŸ”¹ Category sections styled like the current Amazon homepage

ðŸ”¹ Hover effects for better interactivity

ðŸ”¹ Footer with quick links and additional sections

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

HTML5 â€“ structure

CSS3 â€“ styling & layout

JavaScript â€“ image slider functionality

ðŸš€ Improvements I made

âœ… Added an image slider in the hero banner (not in the tutorial)

âœ… Styled the shopping section to match the latest Amazon look

âœ… Added hover effects on category cards

âœ… Organized code for easier readability
